Hack The Meal - hackathon project

##Concept

System uses gamification to make SmartMeal - concept more exiting.

You will have your own pet dinosaur which will react to the way you eat.

There can be different achievements which makes eating more fun.

You will be awarded points from for example eating healthy which you can use to customize your dino or get small dessert for free.

##Tech

System is based on cloud service which is built with NodeJS.

The screen itself uses application which is built with Electron, framework which can be used to build apps on top of chrome browser and javascipt engine.

Communication between display and cloud service is done with websockets.

The programming language was changed from java because java is not the most efficient language when it comes to working with limited resources.

All the data is stored in MongoDB database.
